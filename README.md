================================

Let's celebrate diwali in vizag. For the love of my city. 

After the devastating disaster caused by HUD-HUD. Gov of AndhraPradesh requested(not banned) the celebration of Diwali.
It was a logical decision as there were many dry plants which could have led to a wild fire in the city.
